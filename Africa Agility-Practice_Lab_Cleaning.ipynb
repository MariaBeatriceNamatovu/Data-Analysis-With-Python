For example:\n","- Check the dataset for mistakes, like typos or different formats.\n","- Find out why there are inconsistencies, like human errors or problems with data collection.\n","- Set standard formats for the data, such as using YYYY/MM/DD for dates and 24-hour clock for times.\n","\n","#### Identification of Errors: Datatypes\n","When working with new data, you should always check the data types of your columns by using the `.dtypes` attribute or the `.info()` method.\n","\n","Steps on identifying errors in data types:\n","1. Check Data Types: Utilize the `.dtypes` attribute of a DataFrame in pandas to swiftly examine the data types of all columns.\n","2. Compare Expected Data Types: Refer to the expected data types based on your understanding of the dataset or any provided data documentation.\n","3. Identify Mismatches: Search for inconsistencies where a column's data type deviates from the expected data type. For example, a column designed for numeric values may incorrectly have an object data type due to the presence of non-numeric characters or formatting irregularities.\n","4. Check Unique Values (`.unique()`): Inspect unique values within columns to identify any unexpected or irregular entries that might suggest data type errors.\n","5. Handle Errors: Take corrective actions, which may involve converting data types to ensure consistency and accuracy.
